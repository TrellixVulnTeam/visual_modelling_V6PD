# Visual Modelling
The official repository for Visual Modelling.

## Dataset Download
Find the datasets used [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jumperkables/visual-modelling):

## Running Instructions
1. Python3 Virtual Enviroment
```
mkdir python_venvs
cd python_venvs
virtualenv venv
cd ..
source python_venvs/venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
2. Dataset
Put the downloaded dataset here in the root directory i.e. the root dir "data" should be here in the repo root dir.

3. Results directory
See the results directory for all checkpoints.
```
cd THIS_REPOs_ROOT_DIR
mkdir .results
```

3. Modelling Experiments
As simple as running scripts here. 'mixed' scripts are not currently supported.
```
scripts/runs/modelling
```

4. Test Tasks
Modelling tasks are a touch more complicated.
```
scripts/runs/tasks
```
The simple ones first.
- Random runs are the scripts prepended with "random_"
- Unfrozen with no pretraining are prepended with "no_"
For runs that use *pretrained* models. You will need to add the ".ckpt" object generated by the above modelling experiments (see ".results") to the "--model\_path" argument in these test-task scripts.
- Example scripts for probing pre-trained models are those that are prepended with the numer of epochs they were trained on; e.g. 137-3db\_200 ... means that the pretrained model is one that was pretrained on 137 epochs of 3d Bouncing.
- The finetuning experiments are the same as the above probing ones, but further preprended with "ft_"
